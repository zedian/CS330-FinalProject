### Synthetic Experiments
The notebooks `synthetic.ipynb` and `sharpness.ipynb` will reproduce the results in the final paper. After installing Jupyter Lab and related dependencies (Python 3.8, torch, etc.). One can run in the current directory:

```
jupyter lab
```

We use the publically available implementation of sam.pytorch (in the `thirdparty` directory) for our Sharpness-Aware Minimization experiments.
